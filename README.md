# VertexCover
 WPF/C# application which demonstrates the NP-complete problem of finding a vertex cover on a graph of n vertices.

 The problem, and ways of tackling solutions, is demonstrated in the following forms:

 * Via brute forcing a solution of `k` vertices (where `k` is the total number of vertices the cover must contain)
 * Via preprocessing and brute forcing a solution of `k` vertices (so-called kernelization)

 * Via approximation using an approximation factor of `2`

 ## Requirements
The application uses [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) for visualizing the graph/vertex cover, so make sure you have it installed.

At of now the location for GraphViz is hardcoded and must be:  
`C:\Program Files\\Graphviz\`

 ## Found an issue?
Please do open a bug-report, we appreciate it sincerely :)
